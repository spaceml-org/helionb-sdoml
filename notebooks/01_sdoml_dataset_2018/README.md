# SDO ML Dataset

*A curated data set from the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission in a format suitable for machine-learning research.*

### Overview

While SDO data are easily accessible, pre-processing these data for a  scientific analysis often requires specialized heliophysics knowledge.  The necessity for such pre-processing may act as an unnecessary hurdle  for non-heliophysics machine-learning researchers who may wish to  experiment with data sets from the physical sciences but are unaware of  domain-specific nuances (e.g., that images must be spatially and  temporally adjusted).

### AWS

The notebooks in this repository provide an example of how to access data located on the Google Cloud Platform. In addition to Google, the SDOML dataset (v2.0) is stored on the NASA Heliocloud (Amazon Web Services). Details of how to access the data on AWS can be found here: https://github.com/SDOML/SDOMLv2/issues/3#issuecomment-1534466004
