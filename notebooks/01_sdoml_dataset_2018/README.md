### Overview

While SDO data are easily accessible, pre-processing these data for a  scientific analysis often requires specialized heliophysics knowledge.  The necessity for such pre-processing may act as an unnecessary hurdle  for non-heliophysics machine-learning researchers who may wish to  experiment with data sets from the physical sciences but are unaware of  domain-specific nuances (e.g., that images must be spatially and  temporally adjusted).
